# Rabies Data Analysis — Global & Israel Focus

## Overview  
This project analyzes **rabies cases, control measures, and vaccination availability** worldwide, with a dedicated focus on **Israel**.  

Rabies is a fatal **zoonotic disease** with severe public health implications, especially in countries where it remains endemic.  
By combining **statistical analysis, data visualization, and interactive dashboards**, this project aims to uncover patterns, track trends, and evaluate prevention efforts.

## Objectives  
- **Quantify** rabies cases by country & region over recent years.  
- **Identify** rabies-free countries and factors contributing to success.  
- **Evaluate** control measures, including **vaccine availability**.  
- **Analyze** Israel’s rabies status in depth — cases, vaccination, prevention strategies.  
- **Visualize** trends via charts, maps, and dashboards for public health decision-making.

## Data Sources  
- Global rabies datasets from World Health Organization for animals (https://wahis.woah.org/#/dashboards/qd-dashboard).
- Human deaths from rabies from WHO website (https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/indicators/indicator-details/GHO/reported-number-of-human-rabies-deaths).   
- Official reports from **Israel’s public health authorities** (https://www.gov.il/en/pages/rabies-occurrence-years).  
- Data scraped from [CDC Rabies Country Data](https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/country-data/index.html) using **Selenium**.

### **Project Workflow**  
1. **Data Collection** — Imported CSV/Excel datasets and scraped rabies data from the CDC database.  
2. **Data Cleaning** — Standardized formats, resolved inconsistencies, handled missing values, and ensured data accuracy.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** — Generated descriptive statistics and identified key trends.  
4. **Visualization** — Produced bar charts, pie charts, time series plots, and maps.  
5. **Dashboard Development** — Designed interactive Tableau dashboards with filters, maps, and drill-down capabilities.  
6. **Insights & Conclusions** — Summarized findings to inform public health policy and awareness campaigns.
